# FileSync
FileSync is a file synchronization program that keeps multiple directories synchronized. While still in development, when completed, it should act much like many cloud-based sync programs, only more flexible. It will be able to sync directories located on the same disk, directories located on different disks on the same machine, as well directories located on network locations.
